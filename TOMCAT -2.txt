IQ] How to change port number and why we need to change the port number?

scenario: I need to install tomcat & Jenkins in the same server.

ANS: tomcat port number is 8080 and Jenkins port number also 8080 --> Then we are getting port conflict . [java.net.BindException we will get] , so that we are changing the port numbers.


step 1: goto conf directory.

    cd /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.91/conf

step 2: open server.xml
   
    goto line number 71 and change the port.

step 3: stop the tomcat server and start the tomcat server.

step 4: now try to access with different port number.

NOTE: please make sure to enable the port in Security groups.
